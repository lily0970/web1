<strong>RULE 1. STAND UP STRAIGHT WITH YOUR SHOULDERS BACK</strong><br><strong>Lobsters-and territory</strong><br><p>If you are like most people, you don't often think about lobsters-unless you are eating one. However, these interesting and delicious crustaceans are very much worth considering. Their nervous systems are comparativele simple.</p><img src="peterson.jpg"><p>Lobsters live on the ocean floor. They need a home base down there, a range within which they hunt for prey and scavenge around for stray edible bits and pieces of whatever rains down from the continual chaos of carnage and death far above. They want somewhere secure, where the hunting and the gathering is good. They want a home.</p>This can present a problem.</html></body>
